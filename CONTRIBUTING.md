# Contributing to Mdnotes

Hi! First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to this plugin! Here are a couple of things to note about the status of this plugin and how to best help out.

I am using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the releases of this project. Current versions still fall under this category:

> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

The main reason behind this is that this plugin started mostly as a script for my personal use. As more folks have started using this plugin, and more requests have been coming in, I've decided to do some refactoring to make it easier for other folks to contribute.
Unfortunately, I can only work on this on my spare time, so it might take me a little while before this happens. You can track the progress for that [here](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes/projects/1).

## Pull requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes/pulls) are most definitely welcome if you can spare some time. Before you start working on something, please open an issue to discuss the changes you want to add. **I don't recommend starting any changes until v0.1.0 is released**, as the API is changing dramatically, but if there's something minor that can be easily modified we can discuss that in an issue.

Please keep in mind that any additions you add should be as editor-agnostic as possible. If you want to add something specific for your editor of choice, it **MUST** be optional.

## Opening an issue

Please use the templates I've provided, that will save both you and me a lot of time about details I need to consider your request.
